Specifically, I develop models for the mechanical, thermal, aerodynamic, and electrical performance of different propulsors so that they can be compared in holistic ways. I am particularly interested in the application of these models for use in distributed propulsion aircraft and EVTOLS.\nI am a member of Pembroke College and enjoy swimming and cycling around Cambridge when not in the lab.\n","date":1593388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1656460800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I’m Alexander (Alex) Reaves, a physicist turned aerodynamicist.
