Specifically, I develop models for the mechanical, thermal, aerodynamic, and electrical performance of different propulsors so that they can be compared in holistic ways. I am particularly interested in the application of these models for use in distributed propulsion aircraft and eVTOLS.\nI am a member of Pembroke College and enjoy swimming and cycling around Cambridge when not in the lab.\n","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1657929600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I’m Alexander (Alex) Reaves, a physicist turned aerodynamicist.

In fact, I had such a good time that I decided to come back to my college for 4 more years for my graduate studies. Here my list of tips-and-tricks to hopefully help you have as good of a time as I did.\n1. Travel! Cambridge is very close to Stansted airport, which hosts lots of budget airlines. Flights to Amsterdam, Milan, Stockholm, and other great european destinations can be found for really cheap on budget airlines such as Ryanair or Easyjet.\n2. Get your finances in order… Money is not the most fun thing to talk about, but it is an important thing to consider. If possible, try to open a UK bank account. You will need to provide a letter from your college stating that you are a student and show your UK visa or British Residence Permit.\nIf you don’t have a Tier 4 visa because your program is not long enough for you to need one, then I would recommend opening a Revolut account instead. Revolut will give you a UK account number and sort code and let you send, recieve, and withdraw money in GBP but will technically be a bank acount in whatever your home country is.\n3. Get a dual or e-sim If your phone and carrier allows for it, try to convert your sim card in your home country to an e-sim. This will free up the physical sim card slot on your phone and allow you to have both your UK and home phone numbers on the same phone!\n4. Get a bike! Cambridge is a fairly walkable place, but is best traversed on a bike. Buy a second hand bike from one of the many bike shops in town and take care of it!\n","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657929600,"objectID":"32dc424c08d1eff669554bbd3f334303","permalink":"https://alexanderreaves.me/post/advice_for_uk_visiting_students/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/advice_for_uk_visiting_students/","section":"post","summary":"I loved my time studying abroad in Cambridge.
